    "From looking at average ratings per season, it is hard to draw any concrete conclusions about how people viewed the show overtime throughout its entirety. However, from the shows 5th season to its 6th season (the last season) there seems to be a significant drop in the average rating. Having watched all seasons of Lost, I know that some fans were not happy with how the show ended, so perhaps those fans gave episodes in final season a lower rating, bringing down the average ratings for that season."

    "From this histogram, season 4 has the highest rated episode of the 3 seasons being compared. However, when looking at overall bins, season 1 has the most episodes above a 9.0 rating. So although season 4 has the highest rated episode, it does not have the most episodes with a rating above 9 (season 1 has 8 episodes above a 9 rating and season 4 has 5 episodes above a 9 rating). Depending on how you want to judge the best overall season by looking at ratings, I believe it would be fair to say that season 1 is the best season, but the ratings are similar enough that it could be down to personal preference."
